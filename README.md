# 👋 Hi, I'm Shweta Singh

🎓 M.S. in Engineering Technology @ San José State University  
🤖 Applied AI & Perception Engineer | Working in stealth on visual intelligence systems  
📍 San Jose, CA | Certified in Generative AI, Google AI Essentials, and Cybersecurity  

I’m a **professional data analyst** with over 5 years of experience transforming business problems into actionable insights using Python, SQL, and data visualization.  
My core strength lies in building reliable pipelines and dashboards, conducting statistical analysis, and applying predictive models that drive business decisions.

At the same time, I’m deeply passionate about the intersection of **AI and robotics**, particularly in utilizing computer vision and perception systems to enable intelligent machines to understand and act in the real world.

Currently, I’m working in stealth on a **vision-based robotic perception system** that leverages surface standard analysis and depth-aware mapping to inform safe robotic decision-making.


## 🔬 Featured Projects

- **🎭 Multimodal Emotion Classifier (Text + Webcam)**  
  Built and deployed a real-time Gradio app using BERT (text) + DeepFace (face) for mood detection. Hugging Face hosted and iOS-backend ready.

- **📊 AI-Based Cyberbullying Detection (Capstone)**  
  Achieved 97.45% accuracy using CNN + BiLSTM across Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia datasets. Confidence-based mitigation and real-world testing.

- **💡 Surface Orientation Analysis for Robotics (CV Project)**  
  Built a perception system using pretrained normal maps (DOPNet, PanoFormer) to compute tilt angles, mask obstructed regions, and classify surfaces into safe/unsafe zones.

- **🏥 Medical Cost Prediction**  
  Applied Decision Trees and Random Forests on structured datasets to improve prediction accuracy by 20%.

- **🛍️ E-commerce A/B Testing**  
  Analyzed 50 K+ user sessions using Python/SQL and Tableau to validate UX design hypotheses and improve conversion.
